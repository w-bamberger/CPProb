/**
 * @class Opinion
 *
 * Implements the opinion of subjective logic and the operations on it
 * (see Jøsang, 2002).
 *
 * In subjective logic, an opinion describes the subjective view of an
 * individual about a certain property of the world. In court, for example,
 * some evidence might support the accusation and some evidence might contradict
 * the accusation. And still, there might some lack of knowledge about the case.
 * Subjective logic describes a mathematical theory to deal with the available
 * evidence and the subjectivity behind it. It is related to the theory of
 * evidence of Dempster and Shafer.
 *
 * Below you find a reference section. It contains a complete specification of
 * all scientific references used in the documentation of this class. A good
 * introduction to subjective logic is Jøsang, 2001. You should start with this
 * article to understand the concepts of this class. While the paper only deals
 * with binomial opinions (<tt>size_ = 2</tt>), this class can handle
 * multinomial opinions as well. The mathematics of multinomial opinions is
 * described in the other papers of the reference section.
 *
 * This class represents a general multinomial opinion. It implements it as a
 * template; its only template parameter @c size_ sets the number of possible
 * states. This template implementation is very memory and time efficient, while
 * still elegant and easy to use. So for example, Opinion<2> is a binomial
 * opinion; such an opinion just describes the agreement and disagreement with
 * a given proposition. It is widely used, so it got the dedicated type
 * definition @ref BinaryOpinion. (A binomial opinion is a cluster Dirichlet bba
 * with two clusters.)

          * the discounted evidence can be derived:
          *
          *   S^{A:B} + C = \frac{C}{S^B * (1 - b^A_B) + C} * (S^B + C) .
          *
          * This gives us the relation
          *
          *   R = \frac{S^{A:B} + C}{S^B + C}
          *
          * between input evidence and the discounted evidence.
          *
          * From the first belief equation, the discounting of the evidence
          * values can be derived now:
          *
          *    \frac{r^{A:B}(x_i)}{S^{A:B} + C} =
          *        b^A_B * \frac{r^B(x_i)}{S^B + C} .
          *
          * When resolving for the discounted evidence value, the computation
          * of the belief discounting in evidence representation results in
          *
          *    r^{A:B}(x_i) = b^A_B * r^B(x_i) * R .
          *
